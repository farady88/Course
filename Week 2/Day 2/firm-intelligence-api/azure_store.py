"""
Azure AI Search backend. This is going to do the same job as knowledge_store (count, )

On search call does 3 things:
1. keyword search (BM25) and vector search run together, and Azure fuses them with RRF
2. the semantic reranker rereads the top results beside the question and scores each 0
3. the hits come back best first, carrying that score for the relevance gate (gate.py)
